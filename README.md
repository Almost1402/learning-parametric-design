Companion repository for the "teaching-parametric-design" repository.

**Welcome to parametric design ðŸ‘‹**
This seminar is an introduction creating design artifacts with code. In contrast to other creative coding classes, we take a specific focus on how to use code to create digital artifacts that we can use in other software or even rapid prototyping tools like laser cutters/engravers, CNC machines, 3D-printers or even stitching machines.

You need no prior knowledge of any of those tools and systems. You just need to bring a little curiosity.
